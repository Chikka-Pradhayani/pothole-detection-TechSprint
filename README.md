# AI-Based Pothole Detection

## Project Idea
Road potholes are a common problem worldwide, causing traffic congestion, vehicle damage, and accidents. Manual inspection and reporting of potholes are slow, inconsistent, and rely heavily on public complaints, which often leads to delayed maintenance. This project aims to automate pothole detection using artificial intelligence and computer vision, making road maintenance faster, more accurate, and efficient. The goal is to improve road safety, reduce vehicle damage, and enable smarter infrastructure planning.

## Solution
Our system leverages **AI and computer vision** to detect potholes from images captured by mobile phones, vehicle dashcams, or CCTV cameras. The AI model analyzes road images to identify potholes and mark their locations. This information can be sent to authorities or municipal departments for immediate action. By automating detection, the system reduces human error, improves reporting speed, and enables real-time monitoring of road conditions.

## How the App Works
1. **Image Capture:** Users or vehicles capture road images using a mobile app or dashcam.  
2. **AI Analysis:** The computer vision model processes the images to detect potholes accurately.  
3. **Location Tagging:** GPS coordinates are attached to each detected pothole for precise location tracking.  
4. **Reporting & Notification:** Detected potholes are displayed on a dashboard, and notifications are sent to relevant authorities or municipal teams for maintenance.  

## How to Use
- **Drivers / Citizens:** Use the mobile app to take road photos. The system automatically detects potholes and reports their location.  
- **Authorities / Municipalities:** Access a dashboard showing pothole locations, prioritize repairs, and monitor road conditions efficiently.  
- **Developers / Integrators:** Can extend the system to include real-time alerts, severity analysis, automated repair scheduling, or integration with municipal management systems.  

## Benefits
- Faster detection and repair of potholes, reducing accidents and vehicle damage.  
- Real-time road monitoring for better infrastructure planning.  
- Community-driven reporting system where citizens contribute to road safety.  
- Efficient maintenance planning and resource allocation for municipalities.  

## Future Scope
- Real-time detection using mobile apps, vehicle cameras, or IoT sensors.  
- Severity analysis of potholes to prioritize urgent repairs.  
- Integration with municipal dashboards and smart city systems for automated reporting.  
- Expansion to detect other road damages such as cracks, debris, or traffic hazards.  
- Potential gamification for citizens reporting potholes to encourage engagement.  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how AI can be applied to a common urban problem, combining technology and community participation to make roads safer and maintenance more efficient. The system is designed to be scalable, adaptable, and easy to use for both citizens and authorities.
