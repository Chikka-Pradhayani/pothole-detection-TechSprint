# pothole-detection-TechSprint
Road potholes cause accidents, vehicle damage, and traffic delays, while manual reporting is slow and unreliable. This project uses AI and computer vision to detect potholes from road images and identify their locations, enabling faster maintenance, improved road safety, and smarter infrastructure management
